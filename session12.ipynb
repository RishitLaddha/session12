        "## # NYC Parking Ticket Data Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This program processes NYC parking ticket data stored in a CSV file and performs an analysis of violations based on vehicle make. Instead of loading the entire dataset at once, it uses a **lazy iterator** to read and process data efficiently. The CSV file is fetched from an online source using a URL.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Functionalities\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Lazy Iteration\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead of reading the entire CSV into memory, the program processes one row at a time using a **generator function**. This ensures efficient memory usage, especially for large datasets, by avoiding unnecessary memory consumption and allowing processing of very large files without performance issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "A **generator** in Python is a special type of function that returns an iterator and allows iteration over a sequence of data without storing it all in memory. This is achieved using the `yield` keyword. In this program, the `lazy_ticket_reader` function acts as a generator by yielding one row at a time as a `Ticket` named tuple.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example from the Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `lazy_ticket_reader` function reads a CSV file from a URL.\n",
        "- It processes each row one at a time instead of loading the whole file into memory.\n",
        "- It uses `yield` to return each row as a `Ticket` named tuple.\n",
        "- This ensures that even if the dataset is huge, only one row is held in memory at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Data Storage Using Named Tuples\n",
        "\n",
        "Each row of the CSV file is stored as a **namedtuple** called `Ticket`. This data structure improves readability and structured data access, making it easier to reference specific attributes. The named tuple contains fields such as:\n",
        "- **Summons number**: A unique identifier for the ticket.\n",
        "- **Plate ID**: The license plate of the vehicle.\n",
        "- **Registration State**: The state where the vehicle is registered.\n",
        "- **Issue Date**: The date when the violation occurred.\n",
        "- **Vehicle Make**: The manufacturer of the vehicle.\n",
        "- **Violation Description**: A brief description of the violation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using named tuples provides the benefits of both dictionaries and tuples—readability and immutability—while keeping memory usage low.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Error Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "If a row contains **invalid data**, such as incorrect formatting or missing values, the program **skips the row** and prints an error message indicating the issue. This prevents the program from crashing due to corrupt or inconsistent data.\n",
        "\n",
        "- If a value cannot be converted to the expected type (e.g., `int` for summons number or violation code), an exception is caught, and the row is skipped.\n",
        "- This ensures that errors in data do not halt execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Counting Violations\n",
        "\n",
        "The program iterates through the dataset and **counts the number of violations per vehicle make** using a dictionary. The dictionary structure allows for efficient aggregation of violation data. The results are then converted into a standard dictionary and returned as the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The `count_violations_by_make` function uses a `defaultdict(int)` to initialize counts at zero.\n",
        "- Each ticket's vehicle make is used as a key, and the count is incremented.\n",
        "- Finally, the `defaultdict` is converted into a normal dictionary for easy readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Top 10 Vehicle Makes with Most Violations\n",
        "\n",
        "Below are the top 10 vehicle makes with the highest number of parking violations, as extracted from the final output of `session12.py` when executed:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Vehicle Make | Number of Violations |\n",
        "|-------------|---------------------|\n",
        "| TOYOT       | 112                 |\n",

        "| CHEVR       | 76                  |\n",

        "| DODGE       | 45                  |\n",
        "| FRUEH       | 44                  |\n",

        "| HYUND       | 35                  |\n",
        "\n",
        "## Execution Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The script starts by defining the CSV URL.\n",
        "2. The `lazy_ticket_reader` function reads and processes each row lazily.\n",
        "3. The `count_violations_by_make` function aggregates violations for each car make.\n",
        "4. The final results are printed as a dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Advantages of This Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Memory Efficiency**: Reads data one row at a time, reducing memory usage.\n",
        "- **Improved Data Structure**: Using `namedtuple` makes accessing attributes intuitive.\n",
        "- **Resilient to Errors**: Skips problematic rows without interrupting execution.\n",
        "- **Web Compatibility**: Fetches data from a URL, making it accessible without local storage.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Possible Enhancements\n",
        "\n",
        "- Adding a function to filter violations by year.\n",
        "- Storing results in a database for further analysis.\n",
        "- Visualizing the data using graphs or charts.\n",
        "- Allowing users to input a custom CSV file URL instead of a hardcoded one.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This script provides a **lightweight, efficient, and scalable solution** for processing NYC parking ticket data. By leveraging lazy iteration, structured data storage, and robust error handling, it ensures smooth execution even for large datasets.\n",
